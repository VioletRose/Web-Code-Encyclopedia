<div class="mainText">
	<p>
		The &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; element is used to clarify to the browser what type of HTML file it is opening. This used to be more important in previous versions of HTML, but currently it only exists to separate HTML from XHTML.
	</p>
	<p>
		Example:
		<br>
		&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
	</p>
</div>	
<?php
    require_once('foot.php');
