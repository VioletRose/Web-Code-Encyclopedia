		<p>Welcome to Violet's Web Code Encyclopedia, a project I am working on to familiarize myself with coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, in terms of both study and practice.</p>
		<p>Within this site, you will find visual examples and explanations of the various elements, declarations, and statements that are possible in each language.</p>
		<p>I started this project on Thursday, May 19th 2016, at 23:46 UTC and continue to work on it almost daily!</p>
