		<p>Welcome to Violet's Web Code Encyclopedia, a project I am working on to familiarize myself with coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, in terms of both study and practice.</p>
		<p>Within this site, you will find visual examples and explanations of the various elements, declarations, and statements that are possible in each language.</p>
		<p>I started this project on Thursday, May 19th 2016 at 23:46 UTC and completed it on Sunday, May 21st 2017 at 23:23 UTC! I may decide to add more content in the future, and I will fix any outstanding issues if they come/are brought to my attention, but I have now included and polished everything within the scope of my original intentions.</p>
		<p>Great thanks are due to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> and the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Developer Network</a>, the two primary sources I have been studying from in the course of this project.</p>
