		Welcome to Violet's Web Code Encyclopedia, a project I am working on to familiarize myself with coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, in terms of both study and practice.
		<br>
		Within this site, you will find visual examples and explanations of the various elements, declarations, and statements that are possible in each language.
		<br>
		I started this project on Thursday, May 19th 2016, at 23:46 UTC and finished it &lt;ERROR&gt;.
			<!--The <ERROR> is not actually an error, it's a joke on the fact that this project isn't completed yet, and I'm not allowed to access the future.-->
